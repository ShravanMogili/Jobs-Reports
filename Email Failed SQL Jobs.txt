Email Failed SQL Jobs

http://www.sqlservercentral.com/scripts/110084/

 This code will check for any SQL jobs on your instance which failed and email the details to your specified account. This required a mail profile called DBA alerts (which can obviously be changed). I have put this code into a Job and scheduled it to run at various points throughout the day.

This will save you from going to each job on every sql instance and enabling it is email once failed. As a DBA who has inherited lots of new servers, this has been a time saving solution.
